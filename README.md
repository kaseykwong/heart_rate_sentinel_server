# heart_rate_sentinel_server
This assignment will have you build a simple centralized heart rate sentinel server. This server will be built to receive POST requests from mock patient heart rate monitors that contain patient heart rate information over time. If a patient exhibits a tachycardic heart rate, the physician should receive an email warning them.
